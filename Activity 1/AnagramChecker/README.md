# Anagram Checker
## Problem Description
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams of each other.

The task is to implement a function AreAnagrams that takes two strings as input and returns true if the strings are anagrams of each other, and false otherwise. The function should ignore spaces and treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equal.
